2. In project root directory run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run tests with `npx wdio`

## Review Results

This project supports autogenerated allure reports. Web browsers normally do not support them because security settings forbid Ajax requests on the local filesystem.
in order to open them and review properly you have to:

1. Install Allure CLI tool from [Allure Website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/), choose your OS.
2. In project root folder run command `allure open <allure-report>`
3. This will create simple web-server and open report automatically.
